# Assumptions

1. **Backend Framework & Environment**
   - The backend is implemented using FastAPI and is deployed using Uvicorn.
   - Python 3.9+ is used for development.
   - Environment variables (e.g., `MONGO_URI`) are provided through a `.env` file in development and properly configured in production.

2. **Database & Data Storage**
   - MongoDB is used as the primary data store.
   - Database connections are handled using Motor.
   - For local development, a MongoDB instance (such as MongoDB Atlas) is assumed to be available.
   - Data models for missions and users are defined using Pydantic for validation.

3. **Authentication & Security**
   - Basic authentication using username and password is implemented.
   - Passwords are hashed using bcrypt.

4. **Front-End Implementation**
   - The front-end is built using a low-code platform (e.g., Appsmith) and is provided as an exported JSON file.
   - It is assumed that the reviewer has access to an Appsmith instance (either cloud or locally hosted) to import and test the application.
   - The front-end interacts with the FastAPI backend through REST API calls.

5. **Integration & Deployment**
   - The FastAPI backend is assumed to be deployed and accessible online.
   - API endpoints in the Appsmith application are updated to point to the deployed backend URL.

6. **Performance Considerations**
   - As this is an assignment project, performance optimizations are minimal.
   - Asynchronous request handling via FastAPI is used to improve concurrency.
   - Connection pooling for MongoDB is used in production, though a simpler fresh-connection approach is used for certain scripts and local testing.
